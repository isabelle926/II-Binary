    "\n",
    "Nested iteration refers to the situation where one or more loops are placed inside another loop. This creates a nested or hierarchical structure for iterating over elements in programming. Each iteration of the outer loop triggers the inner loop to execute its complete cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outer Loop:**\n",
    "   - The outer loop is responsible for controlling the overall flow and structure.\n",
    "   - It iterates over a set of elements or performs a specific action a certain number of times.\n",
    "   - For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop is executed in its entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inner Loop:**\n",
    "   - The inner loop is embedded inside the outer loop.\n",
    "   - It performs a set of actions or iterations for each cycle of the outer loop.\n",
    "   - The inner loop can have its own loop variable and control structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in Java:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {        // Outer loop\n",
    "    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {    // Inner loop\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Outer loop index: \" + i + \", Inner loop index: \" + j);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the outer loop runs three times (`i` takes values 0, 1, 2), and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs twice (`j` takes values 0, 1). The result is the printing of combinations of the indices from both loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested iteration is commonly used when working with multidimensional arrays, matrices, or when you need to traverse elements in a nested or hierarchical structure. However, it's important to manage nested loops carefully to avoid performance issues, especially with a large number of iterations."

    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "You are given a 1D array representing a sequence of integers. Write a Java program to find and print the sum of all elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class ArraySumPractice {\n",
    "    public static int calculateArraySum(int[] array) {\n",
    "        // Your implementation here\n",
    "    }\n",

    "\n",
    "        int sum = calculateArraySum(exampleArray);\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Implement the `calculateArraySum` method to calculate the sum of all elements in the given 1D array.\n",
    "2. Use iteration to traverse through each element in the array.\n",
    "3. Print the sum of all elements in the `main` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification allows you to practice working with a 1D array and iterating through its elements to calculate the sum."
